'''You are given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow. The first line of each test case is A and B separated by a space.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the number of bits needed to be flipped.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 103

Example:
Input:
1
10 20
Output:
4

Explanation:
Testcase1:
A  = 01010
B  = 10100
Number of bits need to flipped = 4'''
for i in range(int(input())):
    a1,a2=map(int,input().split())
print(list(bin(a1^a2)).count('1'))
